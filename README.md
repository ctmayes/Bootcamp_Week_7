## Installation Guide

To utilize this program, within your terminal you will have to install the required libraries. Within your terminal, input the following commands:

```python
pip install pandas
```

```python

## Usage

To operate this program, open up your terminal of choice and navigate to the directory in which you have downloaded the files within this repository. Open Jupyter Lab with the command: 

```python
jupyter lab
```  

This should open jupyter lab to the filepath in which you have the repo file, and you simply need double click the *etf_analyzer.ipynb* file to open it. Upon opening, select the menu button with two right facing arrows at the top of the notebook, which will run the entire file. It will ask you to confirm you wish to restart the file, to which you will confirm. Wait a few moments for the program to operate as intended, and peruse the resulting data at your leisure. If you wish, simply skip to the end for my analysis of the preceding information.
